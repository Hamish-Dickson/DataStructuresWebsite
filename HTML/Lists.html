        <h1 class="titleText">Overview of Lists</h1>
        <p>Put Simply, lists are a collection of 1 or more item, each with their own reference point, or index within
            the
            list.
        <p>
            They are useful for storing multiple data entries of the same data type, such as a list of phone
            numbers.
    </div>

    <div id="scene1" class="text">
        <h1 class="titleText">Example</h1>
        <p>Say we had a data set, perhaps lottery numbers for a person.
        <p>The numbers are <b>23, 43, 34, 18, 10 and 7.</b></p>
        <p>
            If we were to use a list to store these items, we would have our data, with each item indexed from 0 through
            5 (indexes start at 0. unless you are using some strange language, but mostly it's 0.)
        <p>We would get the following:
        <p><img src="../Media/List%20example%20initial.png" alt="Data set containing 23, 43, 34, 18, 10 and 7">
        <p>On the next slide I will show you how to implement this in Java, as well as how we can manipulate it.
    </div>

    <div id="scene2" class="text">
        <h1 class="titleText">Example in Java</h1>
        <p>Here I will give some example code of how to use a List in Java. Since List is an interface, we do not create
            lists, rather different types of list.
        <p>for this example, I will use an ArrayList, which is a resizable list that can store multiple instances of
            data for a single type.
        <p>
        <h2>Initialising the ArrayList and adding our data:</h2>
        <p><img src="../Media/List%20Example%20Java%20Initialise.png" alt="Initialising ArrayList in Java">
        <p>Note that the ArrayList and Lists in general can only use Non-primitive data types, so in this example I use
            Integer instead of the primitive int type.
        <p>Also note that the second <> does not need to be filled, as it is implied by the right hand part of the
            declaration
        <p>
        <h2> Retrieving, updating, and removing data from our list:</h2>
        <p><img src="../Media/List%20Example%20Java%20modify.png"
                alt="Getting, adding, removing and clearing the ArrayList in Java">
        <p>Note that if using a LinkedList implementation, the methods getFirst() and getLast() are available to return
            the first and last elements of those lists
        <p>
        <h2>Iterating through Lists</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Using a for each loop: </h3>
        <p><img src="../Media/List%20Iterate%20foreach.png"
                alt="Using a for each loop to iterate through the ArrayList">
        <p>
        <h3>Using an Iterator: </h3>
        <p><img src="../Media/List%20Iterate%20Iterator.png" alt="Using an iterator to iterate through the ArrayList">
        <p>
        <h3>Since java 8, it is possible to use a lambda expression: </h3>
        <p><img src="../Media/List%20iterate%20lambda.png"
                alt="Using a for each loop with lambda expression to iterate through the ArrayList">
        <p>Note that using an iterator is the only way to do this if removing/adding within a loop, such as a game loop,
            as the method is thread safe.
